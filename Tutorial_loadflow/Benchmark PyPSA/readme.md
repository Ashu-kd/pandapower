## âœ… What is PyPSA?
PyPSA (Python for Power System Analysis) is an open-source Python library designed for simulating and optimizing modern power systems. It supports conventional power flow analysis, optimal power flow (OPF), time series analysis, and investment optimization for electricity, heating, gas, and other energy networks.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features of PyPSA:
* Power Flow Analysis:

* Solves AC and DC power flow problems for transmission and distribution networks.

* Handles balanced and unbalanced systems.

* Optimal Power Flow (OPF):

* Optimizes generation dispatch and network operation under various constraints (e.g., voltage, line capacity).

* Investment Optimization:

* Can optimize both operation and network expansion (e.g., adding new lines or generators).

* Multi-Energy Systems:

* Can model electricity, heat, gas, storage, and transport systems together.

* Time Series Analysis:

* Supports simulation of time-varying loads, renewable generation, and demand profiles.

## Scalable:

* Designed for handling large-scale networks (e.g., continent-wide systems).

## Customizability:

* Highly customizable through the Python programming language.

## ðŸ“š Typical Use Cases:
* Power Flow Analysis: Checking voltage levels, line flows, losses, etc.

* Economic Dispatch & OPF: Minimizing generation cost while satisfying demand and network constraints.

* Network Expansion Planning: Determining optimal network upgrades for future scenarios.

* Renewable Integration Studies: Assessing how wind, solar, and other renewables affect the network.

* Sector Coupling: Studying interactions between power, heating, gas, and transport systems.
